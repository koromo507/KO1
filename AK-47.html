        target="_blank" title="AK-47 information">AK-47</a> was chambered in the then newly developed Soviet 7.62x39mm roundâ€”an intermediate cartridge that took influence from the German 7.92x33mm Kurz round used in the StG-44.</p>This caliber was first used in the RPD and SKS.<p>It was designed to be a compromise between the full-sized 7.62x54mmR rifle round and smaller 7.62x25mm Tokarev round used in pistols and submachine guns.</p>
