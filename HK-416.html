    <h2>HK-416</h2>
    <p><h3>The assault rifle is an assault rifle developed by German firearms manufacturer Heckler & Koch based on the AR-15 series of rifles, specifically the Colt M4 carbine family.</p> 
During the 1990s, the United States Army Delta Force, in collaboration with Heckler & Koch American firearms expert Larry Vickers began development of a new rifle to replace the M4 carbine, with the goal to fix the issues with the M16 and M4 designs. Heckler & Koch used their prior experience in developing the G36 rifle - and later during development, the XM8 project - and their successful modernization program of the British SA80 series of weapons in designing the HK416.</h3>
